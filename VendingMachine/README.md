User Guide
Create a new product: Product()
Create a new Snack: Product potatoChips = new Snack()
Create a new Drink: Product powerade = new Drink()
Display product info: displayProductInfo()
Compare two products: product1.compareTo(product2)

How To Run The Program

Approach
This program will have two main working priorities. 
1. user
2. Admin
The user will be able to select products to purchase 
The admin will have the ability to perform the following:
1. Edit product price
2. Remove product inventory
3. Add product inventory
4. View current inventory

Background
First iteration: Planning phase. UML diagrams created.
Second iteration: First implementation of functional code. All 	classes for creating the program backend complete.
Third iteration: Comparable interface implemented for sorting 	the items within the machine.
